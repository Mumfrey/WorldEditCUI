------------

A graphical user interface for WorldEdit. WorldEditCUI is designed 
to assist in using WorldEdit, as well as preventing accidental errors.

to your world, but WorldEditCUI, a frontend for WorldEdit. You must have
WorldEdit installed on your server or in SinglePlayerCommands to use this mod.
